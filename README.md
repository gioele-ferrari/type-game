# Typo ✏️🤲

This app was made to practice using React and Typescript through the most used hooks. It's about spelling the word the right way.

## How to start? 🚩

Just download the project and navigate into the folder type `npm i`, after that just type `npm start` and a local server would be loaded. You can now play the game!

## Future features ⚙️

This app will not have any further changes because it was designed to be simple and without too many pretensions.
